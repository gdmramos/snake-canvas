# Snake Like Clone Game

Inspired by some youtube content and after playing a little with HTML canvas, this little project that still in progress is a way to pratice some concepts and try to reproduce a playable snake game on browser using only html and plain JS.

I'm using node just to run browser sync to be easier to play arround with the code:

```bash
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
```

### Future

This project is the blueprint to begin to learn about IA, when I get this up and running the idea is to experiment with some machine learning concepts to make the computer finish the game.
